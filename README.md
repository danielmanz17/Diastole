Diastole is an audio-reactive piece created using the p5.js library.

This work began with Carl Lostritto's "squiggle" example discussed in his text "Computational Drawing" [1]. The work uses 2-dimensional perlin noise to guide the procedural evolution of the shape. The x-dimension is used to control how the radius fluctuates per squiggle. The y-dimension determines the offset between each squiggle, rendered once per frame. The audio volume scales this offset, and the spectral centroid moves the structure inwards/outwards for low/high frequencies respectively.
